# RNN_stock_prediction
Tried to create an RNN which predicts stock prices based on previous indicators. 

First the data is processed. All the values of the features need to be between 0 and 1. Separate the data into training and test. 

After this the model is trained on the train data for 100 epochs by default.

Finally the model is run on the test data with the trained parameters.
